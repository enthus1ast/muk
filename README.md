MUK
====

![muk](./img.png)



Prototype (!!!) of a crossplattform terminal music and video player.
Inspired by moc and mpd.

Uses the mighty `mpv` as audio backend.

'mukke' is a german slang for music.

Warning, this is not "production grade", use the
network enabled muk/mukd in trusted networks only!
